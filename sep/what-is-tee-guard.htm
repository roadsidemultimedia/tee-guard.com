<h1>What is Tee-Guard?</h1>

<p><img src="../images/what-is-tee-guard.jpg" alt="Tee Guard Corporate Golf Product" class="left" />In short, it is just what the name 
implies. It is a devise made of modern composites that will guard a wooden tee. Tee usage is extended 
dramatically, and keeps the same playing characteristics of the traditional wooden tee. It comes in 
two high visibility colors; White and Yellow. Tee Guard will be very hard to lose.</p>

<p>Tee-Guard comes in two lengths, fitting tee's from 2.5" long through 3.5" long. This is over 90% of 
the tee lengths manufactured for 360cc - 460cc Drivers.</p>

<p>Tee's will not eject from Tee Guard upon impact. This is achieved through our priority, 
"internal locking fins". These locking fins allow for easy insertion and extraction, which 
is another plus for Tee-Guard. Since Tee Shank diameters are different from one tee to the 
next, Tee-Guard was designed to accept and lock onto Tee's ranging from .160 through .180 
shank diameter. Again over 90% of the tee's manufactured, fall into this range.</p>

<p>Tee-Guard is made from a modern composite blend, that strengthens with moisture. In other words, 
the more you use it, the stronger it gets!</p>
<br class="clear" />
<h3>Other minor benefits:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Carry one tee in your pocket! (instead of a pocket full of tee's along with your ball 
	mark and divot tool, you now have one tee in your pocket, which makes everything easy to find!)</li>
	<li>Longer Tee life does help save a tree. (the breaking of less tee's, with millions and 
	millions of golfer, would add up.)</li>
	<li>Your Driver will have fewer face and sole markings!</li>
	<li>Cleaner Tee Boxes! less golf course maintenance for clean up)</li>
	<li>Superior Advertising - imprinted logos, names on wooden tees or Golf Balls - break and or are 
	easily lost. On Tee-Guard, your name, number, logo, is never broken, and your advertising just 
	goes on and on.</li>
	
</ul>

<h1>The Tee-Guard Story</h1>

<p><i>When I went to the bigger sized drivers, and the longer tee's. I noticed two things:</i></p>

<p><i>Much Longer Drives and<br />
The Longer Tee's broke to easily</i></p>

<p><i>A longer Drive is great, but a tee that doesn't last is unacceptable.</i></p>

<p><i>The challenge then was to come up with a Tee-Guard so as to extend the wood tee's lifespan, 
but in no way change or alter the ball flight. All the characteristics of playing with a wood 
tee would have to remain the same. Tee-Guard would have to be light, durable, withstand high 
impact, and be highly visible. The golf tee would have to be easy to insert and easy to extract. 
Another challenge, is that Tee-Guard would have to lock the tee in place and not be ejecting with 
impact. This was the most difficult of all the challenges.</i></p>

<p><i>Therefore with these goals in mind, the engineering and testing began. Though it may seem simple, 
the actual process took many months, with successes and failures, but the goal has been achieved and surpassed. 
So, it does not matter if you are a beginner or seasoned player, man, woman, Junior or Senior golfer, 
Tee-Guard will work for you! It is my pleasure and honor to now present Tee-Guard to the golfing world. 
Instead of your tee lasting 4-6 holes, how about 4-6 rounds and more.</i></p>

<p>Sincerely,<br /><br />
