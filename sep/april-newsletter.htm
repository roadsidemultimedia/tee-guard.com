<p>"I was recently in <i>New Zealand</i> for a number of PGA Senior Tournaments and at one tournament, was fortunate enough to be given a couple of the Launcher Tees.  <i>What a fabulous creation.</i></p>
<p>I am hoping you can tell me where I can purchaser them here in Australia.  I am located on the Gold Coast, Queensland <i>but would be happy to track them down almost anywhere.</i> Look forward to hearing from you soon."</p>

<p>"I was playing golf today and about the 9th hole, I lost my launcher tee.  Using a wooden tee, I wasn't
hitting the ball as far or as straight.  <i>I am sold on this tee.</i>  I can't wait to get the 12 I ordered a couple days ago.   I think that I could be a representative for the Launcher Tee.  <i>I know that they do what the pamphlet says they will do for the golfer. </i>"       </p>

<p>"<i>From one of our Key Rep's Todd Bowman:</i> I had a pro call me this week from Charleston that used a tee I gave him in a tournament recently.  <i>He won!</i>  He was so stoked about the performance of the tee." </p>
