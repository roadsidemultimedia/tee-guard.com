ACE- When a golfer makes a whole in one

<p><b>ADDRESS-</b> The position of the player and his club as they stand over the ball preparing to take a shot.</p>

<p><b>ALBATROSS-</b> Another term for a double eagle. A score of 3 under (less than) par.</p>

<p><b>BAIL OUT-</b> To play your shot to a safe area away from a potential hazard such as water or a sand bunker.</p>

<p><b>BELLY PUTTER</b>- A type of putter that features a longer shaft than a conventional putter. The longer shaft anchors against the stomach, which serves as a center for making the stroke. The connection to the body with a belly putter helps stabilize the wrists through the stroke.</p>

<p><b>BLAST-</b> A shot or “explosion” that is generally out of sand that impacts the sand prior to the ball and results in a splash or blast of sand that hopefully removes the ball from the bunker. The term is derived from the similar appearance of a grenade or other blast in sand.</p>

<p><b>CARVE</b>- The expression has been used to describe shaping or bending a shot to fit a hole’s terrain or curve around something.</p>

<p><b>CUT THROAT-</b> A game played on the tee box while you're waiting for the group ahead of you to move on. Each member of your group places a ball on the ground near the tee marker on one side of the tee box. Using the club you'll be teeing off with, the object is to knock your ball across the tee box, hitting the far tee marker; then back to the side you started on, hitting that tee marker; then take aim at your partners' golf balls, eliminating them by hitting their golf balls with yours.
If you hit the target with your first try, you go again and again until you miss. If you miss with your first try, the next member of the group goes, and so on, taking turns.
If a golf ball goes off the tee box, that player has two turns to get back onto the tee box or he is eliminated. </p>

<p><b>CASUAL WATER-</b> Water on the golf course that is not part of the design. This could be the result of a large or constant rainfall. Casual water must be identified before or after a player has taken his position. Ground that is merely wet, spongy, or muddy is not casual water. There must be an accumulation of water above ground that is visible. Dew and frost are not casual water although snow and natural ice can be.</p>

<p><b>DIMPLES-</b> The small circular indentations on all golf balls designed to improve flight, distance and spin.</p>

<p><b>DIVOT-</b> A portion of the turf that is torn from the ground by the head of a club during the swing</p>

<p><b>DUECE</b>- A score of 2 on a hole</p>

<p><b>EVEN or LEVEL PAR-</b> A situation that develops when a players score is the same as par at any time during their round. If the par on a hole is 4 and you took 4 strokes, you are even for that hole. If par for a round is 73 and you took 73 strokes, you had an even-par round.</p>

<p><b>EXPLOSION SHOT-</b> A shot that removes a large part of sand or earth along with the ball</p>

<p><b>FACING-</b> A grassy incline up out of a bunker in the direction of a green, so that it faces a player attempting to play out of the bunker toward or onto the green.</p>

<p><b>FAN (Whiff)-</b> The action of swinging the club with the intention of connecting with the ball but missing entirely.</p>

<p><b>GIMMIE-</b> A putt of sufficiently short distance (i.e. 6 to 12 inches) that the players in a group agree that it would certainly be holed and as such do not require the player to putt out (one more is counted on the score card).</p>

<p><b>GRIP-</b> This refers to either the part of the shaft by which the club is held by the golfer or the manner in which the golfer holds the club.</p>

<p><b>HACKER-</b> A golfer of low skill who scores poorly and likely takes many divots. A golfer who has little control over their shots. Other terms used are duffer and chopper.</p>

<p><b>HALF SHOT-</b> A shot played with less than a full swing, mainly to control distance, angle and spin.</p>

<p><b>INTERLOCKING GRIP-</b> The standard and most popular grip in golf. The index finger of the top hand is interlocked with the pinky of the lower hand while both thumbs point down the shaft of the club. The lead hand is the one that will be holding the butt-end of the shaft.</p>

<p><b>INVITATIONAL-</b> A tournament in which the players who are competing are limited to those who have been issued an invitation or have automatically qualified for an invitation.</p> 

<p><b>JELLY LEGS-</b> Someone is said to have jelly legs when they are facing a particularly hard putt or may be under a great amount of pressure to make a shot (especially a putt). Usually brought on by extreme nervousness.</p>

<p><b>JUNGLE-</b> A golfers term for heavy rough or in the woods</p>

<p><b>KICK-</b> The action of the ball hitting the ground and bouncing farther or in another direction than expected. A kick usually results from the ball striking a rock, mound or other obstruction. Another word is Bounce.</p>

<p><b>KITTY LITTER-</b> Another term for a sand filled bunker</p>
